    <h3>Cities I've Lived In</h3>
    <p>The first house I remember living in was in North Aurora, Illinois. A few years later, we moved to Northbrook in order to be closer to my parent's work. After I graudated high school, I joined the Space Force and went to San Angelo, Texas for tech school. After finishing, I went to my first duty station in Aurora, Colorado.</p>
